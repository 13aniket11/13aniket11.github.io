    <article style="text-align: justify; font-size: 21px;">Blockchain is a technology to create and maintain a cryptographically secure, shared, and distributed ledger (a database)
         for transactions. Blockchain brings trust, accountability, and transparency to digital transactions. Today, blockchain is “the blockchain” because of Bitcoin. And if you look
         at the reason why Bitcoin was created, there is one word that can describe it better than anything else, i.e., TRUST. Bitcoin was created to overcome the mistrust and 
         non-transparency of financial institutions. Blockchain brings trust to the translation system.
         So, my first question, is your system (current or new) missing the trust factor? Do you need to prove to your customers that the transactions are verified and validated 
         by unbiased third parties? These questions are answered by blockchain technology. Blockchain technology could be quite complementary in a possible space for the future world 
         that includes both centralized and decentralized models. Like any new technology, the blockchain is an idea that initially disrupts, and over time it could promote the 
         development of a larger ecosystem that includes both, the old way as well as the new innovation!

            A blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way.
        Let’s breakdown the definition,
        Ledger: It is a file that is constantly growing.
        Permanent: It means once the transaction goes inside a blockchain, you can put it permanently in the ledger.
        Secure: Blockchain places information in a secure way. It uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain.
        Chronological: Chronological means every transaction happens after the previous one.
        Immutable: It means as you build all the transactions onto the blockchain, this ledger can never be changed.
        A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. Each block records all of the recent transactions, and once completed goes into the blockchain as a permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated.
