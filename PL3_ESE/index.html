                Walchand College of Engineering is situated midway between Sangli
                 and Miraj cities at Vishrambag, Sangli. The WCE campus is located on about
                  90 acres of land on southern side of Sangli – Miraj road.

            <br />
            In 1947, the college made a modest beginning as New Engineering College, with a
             single program leading to B.E. (Civil) degree. In the year 1955, the College was
              renamed as Walchand College of Engineering as part of the new arrangements and 
              pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Development Program mainly funded by Seth 
              Walchand Hirachand Memorial Trust and the Government. The Government appointed 
              an Ad Hoc Committee for conducting the college from May 1955, later replaced by 
              the Administrative Council in 1956. The Ad Hoc Committee added two more degree 
              programs in B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E. (Electrical) in 1955 with the intake of 20
               each. Three Diploma programs also started in 1955 – Civil (40 intake), Mechanical 
               (20) and Electrical (20).
            <br />
            <br />
            Post Graduate programs in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Diploma
             program in Industrial Electronics were introduced in 1971. In 1986 the UG and PG 
             programs in Electronics Engineering and UG program in Computer Science and Engineering
              were introduced.

                PG program in CSE was introduced in 1997. In 2001, added B.E. program in Information
                 Technology with an intake of 60 students. An additional intake of 30 students was 
                 also sanctioned for Computer Science & Engineering program, resulting in total intake
                  of 390 students for all branches at UG level and 106 at PG level. As part of strategic
                   planning, PG section is being strengthened and PG intake has now steadily risen to 240
                    across 10 programs. The College has a QIP scheme for full-time doctoral programs and 
                    also offers Ph. D. programs of Shivaji University in various branches of engineering.

            Walchand College of Engineering became autonomous in 2007. The college revamped its academic
             structure and contents, in consultation with few US and IIT academic experts. Accordingly 
             nomenclature of B.E and M.E programs has been changed to B Tech and M Tech programs. After
              completion of the first term of six years, the College has now received extension of autonomous
               status for the second term of six years till 2019-20. It participated in the World Bank funded,
                Government of India scheme, namely, Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) 
                in Phase I from 2005-2009, wherein it stood all-India 2nd out of 127 participating institutions
                 in terms of program impact performance. The college is presently participating in Phase II of 
                 TEQIP with outstanding performance
